Welcome to my blog! This post shows Markdown + math support.

Inline math like $E=mc^2$ just works.

Block math:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

You can also use lists:

- Point one
- Point two

And code fences:

```js
function greet(name){
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```
